This game is meant to be a bit of a twist on a typical dungeon crawler. Instead of fighting monsters in a dungeon, you are a monster fighting the people who are invading your dungeon and stealing your stuff. 


I planned on making my dungeon linear, but I've spent the last week and a half having to deal with a ton of issues related to my player class inheriting stats from racial bonuses and weapons. So, I still want to continue to work towards that, I have a class made and in progress for rooms, so that I can make it possible for the player to move from room to room in the cardinal directions. But I definitely didn't have time to do it before the deadline. Also I honestly had no idea how to make the Xunit tests work, which may be due to my Xunit stuff needing an update and missing files according to Visual Studio.
